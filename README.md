# File-Compressor-Using-Huffman-Coding

# Compression
  1. Convert the text part into bits using binary tree.
  2. Then bits to ascii( 8bits -> 1byte )
  3. Insert into .huff file.
 
 # Decompression
  1. Convert all ascii to bits.
  2. Then bits to actual character using the tree formed during compression.
